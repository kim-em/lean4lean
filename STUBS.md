# Stub ledger: verified inductives on the ι pattern calculus

Every `sorry` in `Lean4Lean/Theory/` (the `Lean4Lean.Theory` library builds every file under
that directory), with its owner wave. `lake build Lean4Lean.Theory`, `Lean4Lean.Experimental`,
`Lean4Lean.Tests.IotaShape` and `Lean4Lean.Tests.ShapeDecide` are green at wave 0;
`Lean4Lean.Verify` is not yet imported (waves 1 to 3) and the `lake build` default target
therefore fails on `Verify/` until wave 1. Waves follow `iota-port/PLAN-RECONCILED.md`.

| statement | file | origin | owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VEnv.WF.patsStrong` | `Theory/Typing/EnvLemmas.lean` | PR #43 | wave 1D (`patsStrong`), after the 0b spike |
| `VEnv.Model.PatValid.iota` (`-- WAVE 1C STUB`) | `Theory/Typing/HeadInjectivity/Model/PatSound.lean` | new: the `pat` case of `Model.sound` for the registered ι rules (see the wave 1C section) | wave 1C |
| `VEnv.WF.patCtor_rigid` (`-- WAVE 1C STUB`) | `Theory/Typing/HeadInjectivity/Model/WFFacts.lean` | `ConstructorRigidity.lean` on the source branch (`WF.installed_constructor_rigid`) | wave 1C |
| `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff` | `Theory/Typing/UniqueTyping.lean` | master | open on master; the one strengthening principle the checker uses (PORT_PLAN section 5) |

Not stubs but conditional results: everything through `VEnv.WF.orderedStrong` (the strong
system, substitution theorems, inversion lemmas) depends on `patsStrong`; everything through
`VEnv.WF.headInversion` and `IsDefEq.uniq` depends on `patsStrong` (through
`VEnv.WF.orderedStrong`, see the wave 1C section) and on the two wave 1C stubs.
`Injectivity.lean` has no `sorry` of its own: PR #43's `IsDefEqU.const_arity_inv` is derived
from `VEnv.WF'.inductTypeRigid` and `headInversion`.

## Wave 1C: the observation model on the ι pattern calculus

`VEnv.WF.chainHeadInjectivity` and `VEnv.WF.headSeparationModel` (`HeadInversion.lean`) are
theorems: `WF.chainHeadInjectivity_of_sound henv henv.soundEnv` and
`WF.headSeparation_of_sound henv henv.soundEnv`, with `VEnv.WF.soundEnv` from the history
induction `VEnv.WF'.envValid` (`Model/EnvValid.lean`). The model is
`Theory/Typing/HeadInjectivity/{Model,Projections,Rules}/` (22 model files, 4 projection
files, 3 rule files).

**Dependence on `patsStrong`.** The model interprets strong derivations and the extraction
strengthens the weak links of a `TypeChain` by `IsDefEq.strong` (`Model.chain_sub`,
`Model.spine_data`, `Model/Extract.lean`), which takes `VEnv.OrderedStrong` on this calculus;
the substitution theorems (`IsDefEq.substDF`, `IsDefEqStrong.substEq'`) and inversion lemmas
(`HasType.app_inv`, `HasType.const_inv`, `HasType.head_const_lookup`) the model uses take
`OrderedStrong` too. Every model lemma therefore takes `henv : env.OrderedStrong`, supplied by
`VEnv.WF.orderedStrong`, i.e. by `patsStrong`. The history induction uses nothing else from
`patsStrong`: it only ever strengthens derivations of the final environment and of the header
environments of projection entries (`ProjDeclAt`, which now records `envTypes.WF`), both through
`WF.orderedStrong`. A reorganisation that uses `patsStrong` on strict prefixes only would not
remove the use, because the extraction's input is a weak chain of the final environment; the
spike's conclusion stands (`SPIKE_PATSSTRONG.md`, section 3).

**What changed in the port.** `Obs` loses `elimRule` and gains `pat` (`Model/Interp.lean`), of
the same `RuleBind` shape as the stored-rule clause `rule`, which stays for the quotient rule
(the one `defeqs` entry with a constructor major); the reduct template `rhs = wrapLams doms
body` is read off `SimplePattern.iotaRHS'`, the generic leading arguments are
`Model.iotaLead` (bound variables for parameters, motives and minors, a non-variable dummy at
the ignored index positions) and the fields `Model.iotaFs`; the recursor's major domain
(`VExpr.RecShape`) supplies the family `I` and its levels `lsI` to the eta binding; in mode C
the clause records that the rule is the only pattern headed by its recursor. `IsCtor` reads
the constructor of a pattern (`VEnv.IsPatCtor`, `Rules/ConstructorMajor.lean`). `HTS`,
`HeadTy` and the spine lemmas are for constant heads only. `DeltaRules` gains a `pats` field
(no pattern is headed by a defined constant) and loses its inductive case (`addInduct` adds no
`defeqs`). `Model.sound` takes `PatValid` for the patterns of `E` (`Model/Sound.lean`);
`EnvValid` has fields `rule`, `proj`, `pat`. `Model/WFFacts.lean` proves the static facts
along the history: `WF'.defeqs_cases`, the quotient facts (`WF.quotConsts`, `WF.quot_rigid`,
`WF.quotMk_rigid`, `WF.quot_not_projection`), `WF.projStatic`, `WF.isCtor_rigid`,
`WF.installedCtor_resultRigid`. `EnvValid` carries `HeadsClosed` and `PatsClosed` (no later
declaration adds a rule or a pattern headed by an existing constant). Dropped: `EnvTables/`,
`Rules/{Coverage,RecursorEquations,RestoredRecursorEquations}`, `Model/{CaseRule,
CaseRuleSound,RecursorRule,RestoredRecursorRule,Singleton,FamSort,EmptyRule,TeleArity,
CtorArity,ProjMajorWF,ProjMajorRules,ProjStaticWF}` (eliminator registry and stored-equation
provenance); `IotaSoundnessLemmas.lean` is not needed (the stored-equation detour collapses to
`IsDefEq.pat`).

| statement | file | what remains |
|---|---|---|
| `VEnv.Model.PatValid.iota` | `Model/PatSound.lean` | The `pat` case of soundness for an instance `rec us args ≡ rhs us pmm fields` of a registered rule, from the semantic typing of redex and reduct (`HTS.spine`, `HTS.lamSpine`) and the static facts of the block: `VInductDecl.WF.rec_shape` (the `dsH`/`I`/`lsI` data of `Obs.pat`), `rules_ctor`, `PatsIota` and `rules_nodup` (uniqueness), the family's recorded sort (`FamSort`, `Model/FamSort.lean` on the source branch, from soundness of the environment before the block), proof binders of a singleton elimination (mode C, `Model/Singleton.lean` on the source branch), the projection entry of a structure family (eta mode). The two directions are `pat_lhs_sub`/`pat_rhs_sub_head` of `Model/RuleSound.lean` with the instance's spine in place of the λ-wrapped generic sides; `pat_rhs_sub_head` is already stated for an abstract head clause `hrule`. Estimated 1.5k to 2.5k lines. |
| `VEnv.WF.patCtor_rigid` | `Model/WFFacts.lean` | The constructor of a registered pattern is a constructor of its block or of a container block (`VInductDecl.RecsCompiled`, `VRecRule.OfEquation`, the compilation's `equation_major_cases`), hence rigid (`WF'.inductCtorRigid`). The source branch's `ConstructorRigidity.lean`. |

## Not a stub: hypotheses of the declaration judgment

`VInductDecl.WF` (`Theory/Inductive.lean`) keeps the recursor typing (`recs_wf`), the rule
typing (`rules_wf : VEnv.PatTyped`), the recursor shapes (`rec_shape`, `rule_shape`,
`rules_nodup`) and the constructor-constant clause (`rules_ctor`) as *fields* discharged by
the checker verification (waves 2 and 3), not as theorems of `RecsCompiled` as PORT_PLAN 1.4
proposed. Deriving `rules_wf` from the typing of the generated λ-wrapped equations needs
uniqueness and Π-injectivity, both stub-backed in wave 0; wave 2 may either prove it or keep
discharging the field directly from `generatorEquationWF`.

## Wave 1E (executable, tests, divergences)

No stubs: the executable and test ports add no `sorry`. Tests that do not build yet are listed
in `Lean4Lean/Tests.lean` (the manifest of the `Lean4Lean.Tests` library, which no longer globs
`Lean4Lean/Tests/`) with the wave that adds them back:

| test | needs | wave |
|---|---|---|
| `AmbientContext` (PR #43) | `Verify.TypeChecker` | 1A |
| closed-form and translation checks of `QuotInit` (removed from the ported test) | `Verify.Environment` (`Environment.addQuot_eq`, `VEnv.addQuot`) | 1B |
| `InductiveTheory`, `TypedInductiveCompilation` | re-expression for the structure `VInductDecl.WF` and `VEnv.pats` | 2 |

| `CorruptRestoredRecursorMetadata` | `Verify.Inductive.Nested` | 3 |
| `RecursiveFieldClassification` | `Theory.Typing.Interpretation` | 3 |
| `PreludeEq` | `Verify.Inductive.Prelude.EqSyntax`; `VEnv.HasCanonicalEq` only for confluence | 4 |
| `CacheMode`, `SyntacticTranslation` | dropped with the scoped cache mode and the strengthening study | never |

## Wave 1B (environment model)

No `sorry` in `Lean4Lean/Verify/Environment/**`, `Verify/Environment.lean` or `Verify.lean`.
`lake build Lean4Lean.Verify.Environment Lean4Lean.Verify Lean4Lean.Tests.QuotInit` is green
(the `sorry`s it reports are wave 0's and wave 1A's, in `Theory/` and `Verify/TypeChecker`,
`Verify/Typing`).

| statement | file | kind | owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| `InductiveDeclPreserves` | `Verify/Environment.lean` | named hypothesis of `addDecl.WF` (not a `sorry`): a checked inductive declaration, at any fuel, preserves `VEnvs.WF` and extends every safety level | waves 2 and 3 (`addInductiveDeclaration.WF_preserves`) |

Interface notes for the waves that build on this one:

- `VEnvs`, `VEnvs.WF` (now with `blocks : InstalledBlocks safety env (ves.venv safety) .complete`),
  `VEnvs.axiom_of_choice` and `VEnvAt` live in `Verify/Environment/Model.lean`;
  `Verify/TypeChecker.lean` imports it (`-- WAVE 1B COMPAT`).
- `RecursorAlignment.lean` is gone. `Verify/Environment/RecursorCoherence.lean` keeps
  `KLikeAlignment`, `KLikeRecursor`, `QuotCoherent`, `QuotEnvCoherent`; `RecursorRulesCoherent`
  is the K clause only; `EquationHeadsCoherent` is a structure with `defeqs` (as before) and
  `pats` (every registered pattern is headed by a recursor of the map), so `rigid`,
  `rigid_quot` and `rigid_of_fresh` give the two-field `VEnv.Rigid`. The ι rule the checker
  fires is `TrEnv.pats_iota'` (PR #43), which already reads `ctorParams` off the constructor's
  own `ctorInfo` and so covers nested auxiliary recursors.
- `CheckingEnv.Valid` has no `ctorTelescopes`; `InstalledBlock` has no `eliminators` and no
  constructor telescope; `InstalledBlocks.addInduct` takes `decl.WF venv ∧ venv.addInduct decl =
  some venv'` and the K clause of the new recursors (`hrecK`) instead of the old `AddInduct`.
- `AddInduct` (PR #43's structure) has the projection stage: `stR : decl.addRecs (decl.addProjs
  envC) = some envR`, `AddInduct.envP`, `addTypesCtorsProjs`, `addTypesCtorsProjsRecs`.
  `AddInduct.ctor_find` no longer concludes `ctorParams = numParams` (false for nested blocks).
- `TrEnv'` gains `inductProjections` (the projection stage, premise `(env.addProjections
  entries).WF`), and `empty` is either map stage.

Found while porting (not fixed here, `Theory/` is frozen):

- `VEnv.InstalledBelow` (`Theory/Inductive.lean`) still installs a block through
  `VInductBlock.install`, which adds the generated rules as stored equations (`defeqs`). No
  environment built by `VEnv.addInduct` contains them, so `InstalledBelow` fails for every
  container with at least one generated rule in the environments the checker builds, and with
  it `VInductDecl.NestedFormationWF` (which requires the container to be `InstalledBelow`). The installed-blocks invariant uses
  `VEnv.InductInstalled venv decl := ∃ base installed, decl.WF base ∧ base.addInduct decl =
  some installed ∧ installed ≤ venv` (`Verify/Environment/Blocks.lean`) instead; wave 2/3 must
  restate `InstalledBelow` (or nested formation) on `addInduct`.

Parked:

| item | why | owner |
|---|---|---|
| `Verify/CanonicalEq.lean` | needs `Verify/Inductive/Prelude/EqSyntax.lean` and a `VEnv.HasCanonicalEq` whose `Eq.rec` rule is a pattern; `addDecl.WF` no longer needs it | wave 4 |
| `Verify/QuotInit.lean` | replaced by PR #43's `Verify/Environment/Quot.lean` | never |

## Wave 2 header (`Context.lean`, `Context/**`, `Formation.lean`, `Header/**`)

Closed: all four header stubs (`AddInductive.checkInductiveTypes.WF`,
`CheckedHeaders.Describes.headerCertificate`, `AddInductive.declareInductiveTypes.WF`,
`TrInductDeclCore.sourceNames_nodup`). No `sorry` in `Context.lean`, `Context/**`, `Header/**`;
the one in `Formation.lean` is Install's `ConstructorCertificate.withRecs`.

Two more corrections of the scaffold's header interface (both were false as stated):

* `HeaderParameterContext.paramsTr` placed the parameter variables at `.bvar i`; the
  continuation of `checkInductiveTypes` runs beneath the index binders of every family (the loop
  nests them), so they are `.bvar (depth + i)`.
* `declareInductiveTypes.WF` takes `decl.isUnsafe = isUnsafe` beside `Describes` (which does not
  constrain `isUnsafe`), since `HeaderEnvironment.isUnsafe` asserts it.

Interface change (statement of a boundary theorem): `AddInductive.declareInductiveTypes.WF` as
scaffolded was false. Its postcondition built a `ContextWF` over the header environment, whose
`CheckingEnv.Valid` needs every name a header lists to be absent or a constructor of that
header, but `declareInductiveTypes` only checks the header names (a source constructor named
like an existing definition, or like a family of the same block, passes it). The executable
checks constructor names only in `declareConstructors`, after `checkConstructors`. The
postcondition is now `headerEnv.constants.WF ∧ (ConstructorNamesAbsent indTypes headerEnv → ∀
decl, Describes → Nonempty HeaderEnvironment)`, as on the source branch
(`declareInductiveTypes.headersWF`); the consumer (`constructorPhase.WF`) obtains
`ConstructorNamesAbsent` from a successful `declareConstructors`
(`AddInductive.declareConstructors.namesAbsent`, `Header/Installation.lean`), as the source
branch's `formationCoreWF` does (case on `checkConstructors`, then on `declareConstructors`).

Fields added to the header interface (consumers may read them): `CheckedHeader.formation`
(the loop's `HeaderFormation`); `HeaderPhase.{loopHeaders, headers_eq, cache, suffix,
ambientParams}` (the loop's accumulator and parameter invariants); `HeaderEnvironment.
{sourceStatsWF, sourceHeaderParams, statsWF, headerParams, parameterScopeEq}` (the source
branch's `HeaderStatsWF`, built by `HeaderPhase.statsWF` for every described declaration);
`ContextSemantics`/`RecursorContextWF` carry `shapes`/`iota` in place of the cache mode, with
`RecursorContextWF.checkerEnv`. New: `InstalledHeaders` and
`AddInductive.declareInductiveTypes.installedWF` (the header environment before the declaration
is known, as the source's `declareInductiveTypes.headersWF`), `InstalledHeaders.toHeaderEnvironment`.
`declareRecursors.checkRecursorType.WF` (`Context.lean`) now takes a `CheckerEnv` and no cache
mode. The source's top-level `TypeAnnotations.lean` is `Context/TypeAnnotations.lean`; the
helpers the source kept in `Theory/Typing/IotaSoundnessLemmas.lean` and used here
(`VerifyInductive.VExpr.takeForalls_rebuild`) are in `Formation.lean`, with the rest of the
source's `Formation.lean` (`IndexedPrefix`, `List.Forall₂.targets_eq_of_unique`,
`VEnv.addConstVals_append`, ...).

## Wave 2 ctor (`Verify/Inductive/Constructor/**`)

Closed: both constructor stubs (`CheckedFormation.signature`, `AddInductive.constructorPhase.WF`).
No `sorry` in `Constructor/**`; no named stub left. `lake build`, `Lean4Lean.Tests`,
`Lean4Lean.Experimental` green; `--fresh Init.Prelude` (1975) and `--fresh Init.Core` (3953) pass.

* `CheckedFormation.signature`: the family table is read off the header certificate's type
  shapes (`HeaderCertificate.familyTelescope`), the constructors off the checked tails
  (`CheckedFormation.tails`, new field). The empty declaration gets the empty signature.
* `constructorPhase.WF`: `declareInductiveTypes.installedWF` (header), then the constructor check
  `AddInductive.checkConstructors.WF` (`Constructor/CheckRun.lean`: the declaration is the one
  whose constructor types are the raw translations of the run, `accumulatesRawTargets`; the
  certificates come from `checkConstructors.loopTypes.refinesChecked` and
  `loopTypes.ownerNormalFormsWF`), then `declareConstructors` (`Constructor/Declare.lean`:
  `insertConsts` of the `constructorInfo`s, fresh, distinct, nonprimitive) and the constructor
  environment (`Constructor/Install.lean`: `CheckingEnv.Valid` via
  `InstalledBlocks.addCtorStage`, recursor shapes and ι rules, projection-stage `WF` via
  `VEnv.WF.inductProjections`, closure, `InductInfosFromDecl`, parameter alignment).

Interface changes: `constructorPhase.WF`'s postcondition is `∃ R : ConstructorCheck …, R.classes
= out.2` (the scaffold's `Nonempty … ∧ ∀ R, R.classes = out.2` was unprovable: nothing pins an
arbitrary `R`'s classes); `Install/Ordinary.lean` adapted (`-- WAVE 2 COMPAT (ctor)`).
`RecursorInput.constructorTails` is stated over `headers.statsWF.parameterScope`
(`-- WAVE 2 ctor COMPAT`). Fields added: `CheckedFormation.tails`; `ConstructorCheck.{ivals_eq,
ctor_numParams, parameterPrefixes, constructorTails, ownerNormalForms}`. Definitions the
recursor phase imports from `Constructor/Tails.lean`: `ParameterPrefix`, `ParameterSegment`,
`Expr.ForallSpine`, `CheckedConstructorParameterPrefix`, `ConstructorParameterPrefixes`,
`CheckedConstructorTailAt`, `ConstructorTails`, `ConstructorOwnerNormalForm(At/s)`,
`ConstructorScopedTelescope` (= the header's `ScopedHeaderTelescope`).
`Constructor/OwnerNormalForms.lean` imports the recursor agent's
`Recursor/Context/FVarArrays.lean` (whose import closure stays inside
`Constructor/{Tails,Positivity,PrefixUtilities,CheckedFormation,SourceSignature}`).
The source's `Header/Declaration.lean` is not ported: `CheckedHeaders.declOf` selects the
declaration from the checked headers and the raw constructor rows.

## Wave 2 rec (`Verify/Inductive/Recursor/**`, `Rules/RuleSyntax.lean`, `Rules/FromTemplates.lean`)

Closed: `RecursorInput.recursorPhasesWF` (the boundary theorem) and
`InductiveSignature.VRecRule.OfEquation.ofTr`. `Recursor/**` contains no `sorry`; the boundary
theorem's only `sorryAx` sources are the foundation stubs `VEnv.WF.patsStrong`,
`VEnv.Model.PatValid.iota`, `VEnv.WF.patCtor_rigid`, `VEnv.IsDefEqU.weakN_iff`. Ported: the source
branch's `Recursor/**` (65 files, about 41.8k lines) and `Rules/{RuleSyntax,FromTemplates}` (2.5k,
lead's ruling: they sit inside the recursor chain).

Structure: `RecursorInstallation` (`Recursor/Installation.lean`) is the source branch's
`RecursorCheck` (extends `RecursorConstruction`), produced by `RecursorInput.recursorInstallationWF`
(the source's run theorem); `Recursor/Recs.lean` reads the kernel recursors `rvals` and the model
recursors `recs` (rules: `ctorParams := decl.nparams`, `rhs :=` the generated equation's) off it,
with every shape clause of `VInductDecl.WF`; `Recursor/Checking.lean` proves the checking
invariant at the recursor stage (`InstalledBlocks.addCtorStage` from the source blocks, install's
`recursorShapesOf`); `RecursorInstallation.toRecursorCheck` (`Recursor/Check.lean`) assembles the
frozen interface. The rule coverage is the rule phase's `RecursorInstallation.rulesCovered`
(`Rules/Coverage.lean`).

Interface changes (all agreed with the lead or the owner):
* `RecursorCheck` gained `installation : RecursorInstallation R outEnv` with
  `installation_{elimLevel,kTarget,outVEnv,rvals,signature,generation,recs,rvals'}` and
  `rules_ctorParams`.
* `RecursorCheck.trRecs` and PR #43's `AddInduct.recs` translate recursor types in the projection
  stage (`R.envP`, `decl.addProjs envC`), where the executable checks them (`-- WAVE 2 rec COMPAT`
  in `Verify/Environment/Basic.lean`, `Verify/Environment/Lemmas.lean`, `Install/Rebase.lean`).
* `VRecRule.OfEquation.ofTr` takes the index-count side condition `harity`
  (`Models.constructorArity`); `ofTrModels` discharges it from a modelling signature.
* `RecursorInput.literalDisjoint` (install's field) supplies positivity's literal side condition.

Recursor-side homes of source content that lived elsewhere on the source branch:
`Recursor/Inputs.lean` (the source `ConstructorCheck`'s header-side members on `RecursorInput`:
`sourceContext`, `statsWF`, `parameterScope`, `recursorHeaders`, `headerLE`/`ctorLE`/`sourceLE`,
`find?_origin`, `headerInfo_find`, `ctorInfo_find`, `modelCtorAt`), `Recursor/SourceAlignment.lean`,
`Recursor/Signature/RecursorTypeTelescope.lean` (from `Nested/Restoration/ExprReplace`),
`Recursor/Signature/SourceReplay.lean` (the replay-based source signature of the source
`Constructor/{SourceSignature,CheckedFormation}`), `Recursor/Entries/Metadata.lean` (from
`Install/Metadata`). Dropped: the case-eliminator and telescope-certificate lemmas
(`addEliminators`, `SourceCtorsCertified`, `CtorTelescopeAt`), `RecursorCheck.alignmentOfTr`
(replaced by install's `recursorShapesOf`), the old `AtomicAddConstants` helpers; the constructor
loop's production (owner normal forms, parameter prefixes) moved to `Constructor/**`.

## Wave 2 rules (`Verify/Inductive/Rules/**`)

`RecursorCheck.generatedRuleTranslation` is proved. The source branch's `Rules/**` is ported onto
the recursor installation (`RecursorInstallation`, the source `RecursorCheck`): `Rules/{Alignment,
MinorContext,MinorPremise,Motive,RecursiveCallScope,RecursiveCall,RecursiveApplication,
EquationTranslation,RecursiveBody,RecursiveResults,Rhs,Lhs,EquationWF,LhsTranslation,Translation}`,
with the assembly in `Rules/Coverage.lean` (`RecursorInstallation.rulesCovered`, which the recursor
phase uses to build `TrRecursor`, and `equationsWF'`). Support ported from other source
directories into `Rules/`: `ContextLemmas.lean` (`rebaseCommonSuffix`, from `Install/Lookups`),
`SameForallPrefix.lean` (from `Nested/Restoration/ParameterOpening` and
`Nested/Lowering/ParameterOpening`), `InstallationLemmas.lean` (from `Install/BlockCertificate`).
`rules_wf : PatTyped` is the restatement of the generated equations' `VDefEq.WF`
(`Instance.equation_patTyped`, `Rules/IotaPatTyped.lean`; `RecursorCheck.rules_wf_of`,
`Rules/RulesWF.lean`). `RecursorCheck.rules_ofEquation` gives `VInductDecl.RecsOf`'s rule clauses.
Foundation changes met in the port: `.ordered` → `.orderedStrong` where `TrExprS.weakBV`/
`VLCtx.IsDefEq.refl` now take `OrderedStrong`; constructor lookup through `R.core.ctorsAdded`.
The rule chain's only `sorryAx` dependencies are the foundation's `VEnv.WF.patsStrong`,
`Model.PatValid.iota`, `WF.patCtor_rigid`, `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff`.

No named stub remains in `Rules/**`. `RecursorCheck.rulesCovered`/`equationsWF` are read off the
installation (`installation_*`); `ruleCtorParams` is the Recursor agent's `rules_ctorParams` with
`models.nparams`.

`Rules/RuleSyntax.lean` and `Rules/FromTemplates.lean` are the Recursor agent's (lead's decision:
the source's `Recursor/**` imports them).

## Wave 2 install (`Install/**`, `Primitive/**`, `Prelude/**`, derived `RuleTranslations` facts)

No `sorry` left in the install/primitive/prelude directories. Closed: `BlockCertificate.installedBlocks`
(`hpres`), `rebase`, `extendSafeExact`, `extendUnsafeExact`, `RecursorCheck.blockCertificate`,
`Kernel.Environment.checkDuplicatedUnivParams.WF`, `RuleTranslations.blockWF`/`compilesTo`/`recsOf`
(`recsOf` through the rule phase's `rules_ofEquation`), `ConstructorCertificate.withRecs`,
`checkPrimitiveInductive_eq_true_iff`, `loweringRun.primitiveNoop`, the recursor-names-not-primitive
`sorry`, `AddInductive.constructorPhase.primitiveWF`, and wave 1A's `VEnvAt.recursorShapes`
(`Verify/TypeChecker.lean`, now read off the installed-block descriptors). `Prelude/{EqSyntax,EqReady,Eq}`
are ported (the `QuotReady` half: `Environment.addInductive.preludeEqExtensionWF`; the `HasCanonicalEq`
half stays with `Tests/PreludeEq`, wave 4).

Interface changes (all marked `-- WAVE 2 install COMPAT`):
* `Verify/Inductive/HeaderData.lean` (new, shared): `LocalContextWF` (`ContextWF` with `checking :
  CheckingEnv`, no `HasPrimitives`/`shapes`/`iota`) and `HeaderData` (`HeaderEnvironment` with
  `context : LocalContextWF`, without the header context's `parameters`), `HeaderEnvironment.toData`.
  The header-only environment of `Bool`/`Nat` violates `HasPrimitives`, so no `ContextWF` exists there.
* `Verify/Inductive/RecursorInput.lean` (new, shared): `RecursorInput` = `ConstructorCheck` with its
  `CheckedFormation` fields flattened under the same names and `headers : HeaderData`;
  `ConstructorCheck.toRecursorInput`, `CtorInstall.toRecursorInput`. `RecursorCheck`,
  `RuleTranslations`, `RecursorInput.recursorPhasesWF` (renamed from `ConstructorCheck.recursorPhasesWF`),
  `blockCertificate` and `OrdinaryInstallation` are indexed by `RecursorInput`.
* `Constructor/{Checked,Install}.lean`: `ConstructorsChecked` and `CtorInstall` are over `HeaderData`;
  `CtorInstall.nprim` is replaced by `hasPrimitives` (of the constructor model) and `safePrimitives`
  (of the constructor environment); the ordinary path proves both from nonprimitive names
  (`CtorInstall.ordinaryPrimitives`); shapes/iota/equation heads/quotients and the parameter context come
  from the source context. `Constructor/CheckRun.lean`: `checkConstructors.WF` concludes
  `ConstructorsChecked H.toData`.
* `Verify/Environment/Blocks.lean`: `RecursorShapes` moved here (from `TypeChecker/CheckerEnv.lean`);
  `InstalledBlock.WF` gains `shapes : ∀ r ∈ B.recursors, visible → RecursorShapesAt env.constants venv r`;
  `addBlock`/`addInduct` take `hrecShapes`, `addCtorStage` takes it as an auto-discharged argument.
  `InstalledBlocks.recursorShapesCoherent` (`TypeChecker/CheckerEnv.lean`).
* `RecursorInput`, `ConstructorCheck` and `CtorInstall` gain `literalDisjoint` (positivity's literal
  side condition, `AvailableLiteralDisjoint`, in the recursor phase's context; requested by rec).
* `BlockCertificate` gains `compiled` (a well-formed compiled block, for `rebase`), `newUnsafe` (inserted
  constants carry the declaration's `isUnsafe`) and `recShapes`; `rebase` takes `ves.WF env` and
  `decl.isUnsafe = false`. `RuleTranslations.compilesTo`/`recsCompiled`/`recursorsWF` take
  `indTypes.toList ≠ []`.

Owed by wave 3: every caller of `InstalledBlocks.addInduct` (the nested installation) supplies
`hrecShapes`, i.e. `RecursorShapesAt` of each new recursor, auxiliary recursors included (their majors are
containers at specialized arguments, so `recursorShapesOf`, which reads the major off `MajorApp` and the
rules' constructors off the source declaration, does not cover them).

## Wave 2 scaffold (`Verify/Inductive/**`, the inductive refinement's interface)

`lake build` (default targets), `Lean4Lean.Tests` and `Lean4Lean.Experimental` are green with
`Verify/Inductive/**` imported by `Verify/Environment.lean` through `Verify/Inductive/Dispatch.lean`.
`InductiveDeclPreserves` is now the theorem `inductiveDeclPreserves (hnested :
VerifyInductive.NestedInductivePreserves)`; `addDecl.WF` takes `hnested` (wave 3's branch) and
`addDecl.WF_of` keeps the `InductiveDeclPreserves` form. The interface, the ownership map and the
dependency order of the five follow-on agents are in `Lean4Lean/Verify/Inductive/README.md`.
Every `sorry` of the scaffold is one of the named stubs below (`-- WAVE 2 STUB (owner)` in the
source); the owner is the directory agent of README.md's ownership map.

Not a stub: `VerifyInductive.NestedInductivePreserves` (`Verify/Inductive/Dispatch.lean`), the
named hypothesis of the nested branch (the source branch's
`Environment.addInductiveAfterLowering.nestedInductiveExtensionWF`), owner wave 3.

Wave 1A's two stubs stay (`VEnvAt.recursorShapes`, now consumed by `ContextWF.initial`;
`VEnv.Ordered.patsAvoidFreshConsts`), owner Install for the first (from `InstalledBlocks` and
`VInductDecl.WF`'s `rec_shape`/`rules_ctor`), wave 2 for the second.

Theory COMPAT of this wave (`-- WAVE 2 COMPAT`): `VEnv.addInduct`'s stages and
`VInductDecl.RecsOf`/`VRecRule.OfEquation` moved to `Theory/Inductive/AddInduct.lean`;
`ContainersInstalled.cons` (`Theory/Inductive/Compilation.lean`) and `VEnv.InstalledBelow.intro`
(`Theory/Inductive.lean`) now install the container by `base.addInduct container = some installed`
with `container.RecsOf block` (and still `block.WF base`), replacing `VInductBlock.install`; the
`InstalledBelow` lookup lemmas moved to `Theory/Typing/InductiveLemmas.lean`. This resolves wave
1B's `InstalledBelow` finding below and wave 1C's `ContainersInstalled` finding. No new `sorry` in
`Theory/`.

Still deferred in `Lean4Lean/Tests.lean`: `InductiveTheory`, `TypedInductiveCompilation`,
`CorruptRecursorMetadata` (they need the recursor phase's internals, not just the interface).

## Wave 1A (checker verification)

`lake build` (default targets), `Lean4Lean.Tests` (with `AmbientContext` restored) and
`Lean4Lean.Experimental` are green. Outside `Theory/` the only `sorry`s are these two:

| statement | file | why | owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VEnvAt.recursorShapes` | `Verify/TypeChecker.lean` | the recursor and constructor telescopes (`VRecursorShape`, `VConstructorShape` at the constructor's own parameter count) of every visible recursor of a complete model. Recursor reduction needs them to show the constructor application of a well-typed ι redex saturated. On the source branch they were part of the installed-block invariant (`RecursorAlignmentCore`); `VInductDecl.WF` only records the syntactic `rec_shape`/`rules_ctor` (`CtorShape` does not say the constructor ends in its family at the parameter variables), so they must come from the formation data of the installed declaration. Every other fact the checker reads (`CheckerEnv`) is wave 1B's `CheckingEnv.Valid` or PR #43's `TrEnv.pats_iota'` | wave 2 (installed blocks) |
| `VEnv.Ordered.patsAvoidFreshConsts` | `Verify/Typing/ConstSupport.lean` | the `pat` case of `IsDefEq.noConsts`: the fixed parts of a registered rule's right-hand side avoid names absent from the environment. `VEnv.PatTyped` types a generic instance in an arbitrary context, so the template's constants are not bounded by the environment without a further argument. Used only by `VExpr.WF.noFreshConsts` (constructor positivity) | wave 2 (or a `PatWF` that types the template in the empty context) |

Interface for the waves that build on this one: the checker reads its environment through
`CheckerEnv safety env venv` (`Verify/TypeChecker/CheckerEnv.lean`), which extends
`CheckingEnv.Valid` by `shapes : RecursorShapesCoherent` and `iota : IotaRulesRegistered`
(`TrEnv.iotaRulesRegistered` proves the latter from `TrEnv`). An inductive declaration that runs
the checker in an intermediate environment must supply both there.
