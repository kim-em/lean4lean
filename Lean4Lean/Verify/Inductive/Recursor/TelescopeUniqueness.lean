/-! Uniqueness of translated binder telescopes.

A list of abstract domains translating a list of source domains, each in the
abstract context of the earlier ones, is determined by the sources.  A
well-formed lambda-only typechecker metacontext supplies such a telescope:
each stored binder type, abstracted over the earlier identifiers, translates
to the stored abstract domain in the abstract context of the earlier
domains. -/
