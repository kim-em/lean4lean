/-! Typed models and elimination admissibility for the pure signature generator (section 2.2
of `docs/inductives/DESIGN.md`): `Models` relates a signature to a source declaration,
`Instance.Admissible` fixes the elimination universe, and `Compiles` is ordinary compilation. -/

/-- Exact family/constructor names and constructor types modulo typed
definitional equality.  The source constructor types are compared in the
environment containing the source family headers, before any recursor or
equation is installed.  The family types are not compared: a family's
signature telescope is required only to be well formed and to type the family
applications at the recorded sort (`FamilyTypesWF`, a clause of `Compiles`),
because the recursor phase computes the index telescope in a context in which
definitional agreement with the declared one is not derivable. -/

  universes, in the branch its classification names
  (`VInductDecl.ClassifiedFieldNormalForm`): an `external` field is
  definitionally a type free of the families being defined, a `recursive` field
  is definitionally a telescope over family-free domains ending in a family
  applied to the parameters and family-free indices.  So the generator gives an
  induction hypothesis exactly to the fields whose positive normal form ends in a
  family: a recursive field cannot be declared `external`, and a family-free field
  cannot be declared `recursive`.  The recorded shape of a recursive field (its
  binders, target family and indices) is constrained by the typing of its generated
  induction hypothesis (`Instance.GeneratedIHsWellTyped`).  Unsafe declarations, which
  are not checked for positivity, are exempt. -/

/-- The elimination universe is a universe parameter on which the source
universes do not depend, so the recursor can be specialized to any motive
universe, in particular to `Prop`, without changing the family. This is the
shape of Lean's recursors (`getElimLevel` returns a fresh parameter). -/

/-- Admissibility is checked at the instance's source universes. In particular,
a Sort-polymorphic family can acquire large elimination after specialization
without changing its recursor's type.

Singleton (large) elimination additionally requires a free elimination universe
(`Instance.FreeTarget`). Without it, `VEnv.WF` would admit a large-eliminating inductive
proposition whose only recursor has motive universe `succ u`; its proof fields could then
not be extracted (there is no elimination into `Prop`), so its iota rule would have no
reconstruction step and `FullEquationCoverage` would fail. Lean never produces such
recursors, and the executable's recursor construction satisfies the free shape (section 2.4
of `docs/inductives/DESIGN.md`). -/

/-- Each generated induction hypothesis is a well-formed type in the context in
which the generated minor premise binds it: parameters, motives, earlier
minors, the constructor's fields and the earlier hypotheses.  This is the
typing fact the generated recursor needs from the recursive shapes.  Which
fields get a hypothesis is fixed by `Models.classifiedFields`.  It is
stated in the recursor-checking environment, that is after the family headers, the
constructors, the declaration's own case eliminators and its projection entries,
since that is where the executable checks the generated types.  A
definitional-equality form in a smaller context is not derivable from the
checker's runs without context strengthening of definitional equality, which is false
in general (section 5.1 of `docs/inductives/DESIGN.md`). -/

/-- Well-formed family applications: the signature's parameter and index
telescope is a well-formed context, and each family applied to its parameters
and indices has the recorded result sort, in the recursor-checking
environment.  Definitional agreement of each index domain with the
declared family type in its own prefix is not derivable from the checker's
runs (context strengthening of definitional equality), so this clause
records what the generated motive types need. -/
